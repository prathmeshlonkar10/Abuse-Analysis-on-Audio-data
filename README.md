## Highlight
Our goal is to create an adaptable and user-friendly application that processes real-time audio data to detect potential verbal abuse victims. By leveraging advanced machine learning techniques, we aspire to empower this application to not only identify instances of abuse but also facilitate rapid victim support, ensuring a safer and more compassionate world for all.

The RNN model is trained on the Kaggle audio [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fangfangz/audio-based-violence-detection-dataset/data) and identifies the instances of audio-based verbal abuse. The dataset was split for training the model on violent as well as non-violent audio data. Later on, the model was tested on live audio to determine whether the captured audio indicated signs of violent verbal abuse.
